# LinuxKernelDevelopment
**Project Status: Ongoing**

This project is an exploration of the Linux kernel and its interaction with hardware, specifically developed for x86-64 and arm64 architectures. Initially created for use with my ARM-based Raspberry Pi 5 running Raspberry Pi OS, the current version has been designed for x64-based systems. Certain functionality related to GPIO pins and breadboard integration, originally intended for the ARM version with the Raspberry Pi, has been commented out in this version. The final iteration of the project will focus primarily on supporting the Raspberry Pi. 
# Features
* File hiding via syscall hooking
* Module Hiding via removal from the linked list
* Persistence via cronjob configuration files
* Privilege escalation via modifications to the sudoers file
* kill hooking to recieve commands from user

# Upcoming Features
* ARM support
* Version 2 will explore eBPF, which appears to be an interesting avenue for further investigation
* Pictures of functionality, bugs, and the breadboard
# Installation and Requirements
This project has been tested on the following configurations:
* Ubuntu 24.01 with kernel version 6.11 (x86-64)
* Raspberry Pi OS version 6.6 (ARM), based on Debian v12

Please note that backportability is not supported, and there are no plans to offer it in the future. If you are interested in testing this project and potentially causing a kernel segmentation fault or system instability, you are welcome to clone the repository and insert the module. For safety, it is strongly recommended to test this in a virtual machine.

## Installation Steps

> git clone https://github.com/TheodoreC13/LinuxKernelDevelopment/main/

cd into the folder and make

> cd ~/Github/LinuxKernelDevelopment/ && make

Insert the mod into your kernel

> sudo insmod breadboard.ko

You will need to unhide the module to remove it normally

> kill -63 999

> sudo rmmod breadboard

# Known Issues
x64  
> segmentation fault when running lsmod

Edit: Upon writing this and reviewing my files I'm pretty sure I know what's causing this segfault.
